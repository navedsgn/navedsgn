- 👋 Hi, I’m @navedsgn
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching myself the basics of coding in hopes of developing websites and apps on my own.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of C# because of its wide capabilities.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects on the raspberry pi, while c# doesnt do much with that, the basics I believe will translate well.
- 📫 How to reach me: go to my website, evanfurnish.com and email me there in the contact me tab.
